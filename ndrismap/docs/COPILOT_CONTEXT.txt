You are assisting in building a civic-tech web application called NDRIS-Nepal
(National Disaster, Responsibility & Impact System).

PROJECT PURPOSE:
This system integrates:
- Disaster memory records
- Citizen grievance submissions
- Policy impact tracking
- Urban Neglect Index computation
- Interactive SVG-based Nepal map visualization

TECH STACK (DO NOT DEVIATE):
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript only
- Backend: Procedural PHP 8
- Database: MySQL / MariaDB using MySQLi
- Map: SVG + JavaScript (based on INTmap project)

STRICT RULES:
- NO frameworks (no Laravel, React, Vue, etc.)
- Use MySQLi prepared statements for ALL database queries
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Modular PHP files (one responsibility per file)
- Comment all major logic blocks clearly
- Avoid political or opinionated language in UI and comments

DATABASE:
Follow exactly the schema defined in /docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md.
Do not invent new tables or fields without justification.

FILE STRUCTURE:
Follow the project structure defined in /docs/FILE_STRUCTURE.md.

CODING STYLE:
- Procedural PHP only
- Clear variable names
- No magic numbers (use comments if needed)
- Security-aware but not over-engineered

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
When generating code:
- Generate complete, working files (not fragments)
- Match the project architecture
- Ensure code can run on XAMPP (Apache + PHP + MySQL)
- Keep output readable and minimal

ETHICAL CONSTRAINT:
This project is neutral, data-driven, and non-political.
All indices are heuristic and explanatory, not judgmental.

GOAL:
Help build a clean, functional, and academically defensible CRUD-based web system
that demonstrates full-stack PHP development with interactive data visualization.
